# GMTK Game Jam
This is our submission for the 2020 Gamemaker's Toolkit Game Jam.

## The Project
We're making a game where you pilot a ship through space, hoping to reach a space station on the opposite end of the galaxy. The twist: Your ship is on fire! And it must stay on fire throughout the entire journey!

## Playing the game
Simply launch the executable "I Am Not On Fire Yet.exe" to play the game.
