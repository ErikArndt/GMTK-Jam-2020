# GMTK Game Jam
This is our submission for the 2020 Gamemaker's Toolkit Game Jam.

## The Project
We're making a game where you pilot a ship through space, hoping to reach a space station on the opposite end of the galaxy. The twist: Your ship is on fire! And it must stay on fire throughout the entire journey!

## TODO:
(edit as the project progresses)
* S - make images for dashboard things (resource bars, radar, firing lasers)
* S - make images for special rooms
* S - make images for text boxes?
* Do we want an image for sprinklers? Water drop, maybe?
* Make a ship, so these rooms aren't floating in space (S or C in pygame)
* repair system and breaking modules (for level 3)
* tutorial
* sound effects (much more effective than a complex visual alert system)
* red flash when you take damage (should be pretty simple)
