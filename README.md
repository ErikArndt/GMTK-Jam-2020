# GMTK Game Jam
This is our submission for the 2020 Gamemaker's Toolkit Game Jam.

## The Project
We're making a game where you pilot a ship through space, hoping to reach a space station on the opposite end of the galaxy. The twist: Your ship is on fire! And it must stay on fire throughout the entire journey!

## TODO:
(edit as the project progresses)
* differentiate the rooms
* add more interesting stuff to the dashboard
* incorporate Sarah's empty room picture
* incorporate Sarah's fire pictures (when done)
* make images for dashboard things (resource bars, radar, firing lasers)
* make images for text boxes (will be used for tutorial messages)
