# GMTK Game Jam
This is our submission for the 2020 Gamemaker's Toolkit Game Jam.

## The Project
We threw out some ideas a few weeks ago, but nothing concrete. I don't remember most of that conversation, but I know I (Erik) would like to try making our own version of the Child of Light combat system.
It really depends on the theme, too.

(edit as the project progresses)
