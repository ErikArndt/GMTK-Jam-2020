# Game-Jam-Practice
Our team is planning to enter the 2020 GMTK Game Jam, and we are using this project as an excuse both to brush up on our coding skills and to familiarize ourselves with the tools we'll be using.

## The Project
We threw out some ideas a few weeks ago, but nothing concrete. I don't remember most of that conversation, but I know I (Erik) would like to try making our own version of the Child of Light combat system.

## The Tech Stack
We'll be creating the game with Pygame. Art will either be hand-drawn, or freely available assets found online. That's pretty much it.

## TODO:
(edit as the project progresses
* Brainstorm the concept
